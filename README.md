# Dotfiles

This repo contains dotfiles for my personal development environments. It includes setup scripts to install dependencies from scratch or update the local dotfiles.

Installed packages:
  * [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
  * [zsh and oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

Installed zsh plugins
  * [zsh-history-substring-search](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search)

The applied tmux theme is a custom combination of the 'bureau' and 'ys' themes. It has the 'ys' look and feel with a shortened descriptor line and the 'bureau' git icons.

To apply changes to you current environment, run the ```update-env.sh``` script.

To setup a new environment, run the ```make-new-env.sh``` script.
